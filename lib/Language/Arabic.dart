      'The adult insect: It is a large insect, with a reddish-orange color, its length ranges between 2.5-4 cm. There are a number of black spots on the back of the thoracic ring that may vary in number and shape. It has a shorter proboscis in the male, and it bears bristles at the end and near its base. Antenna horns come out on either side. The whole insect has the ability to fly relatively long distances 1-7 km, and is not attracted to light traps, and it has 3-4 generations per year.',

      'The egg: oblong, glossy creamy white in color, smooth surface, 2.5 mm long and 1 mm wide.',
  'c':
      'Larva: It is the harmful stage, and it is legless, yellowish-white in color, oval in shape, with a blackish-red head and strong biting mouthparts. The fully developed larva is 3.5-5 cm long and has a limited ability to move as it pushes the body forward and then the rest of the body in successions. The larva feeds greedily on the vascular tissues, making tunnels in all directions inside the trunk of the palm tree.',
  'd': 'Cocoon: looks like a barrel, about 7 cm long and 2.5 cm wide.',
  'e':
      'Virgin: It is creamy in color, turning brown in the last stages. The pupal averages 3.5 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width. The pupal stage is dormant and inactive inside the cocoon, during which it gradually transforms into the adult insect stage.',
  'f':
      'The life cycle of the weevil: the insect develops from an egg to a larva to a pupa inside a cocoon and then to an adult insect, as it is active and reproduces throughout the year and does not have a winter or summer hibernation. During her lifetime, the female often lays 250 to 300 eggs in openings she digs on the trunk or in holes and tunnels dug by other insects, as well as in wounds inflicted by the farmer during agricultural operations on the palm tree. After a few days, 2-5 days, the eggs hatch and give birth to small larvae at first, which grow gradually, dig tunnels and feed greedily on the living vascular tissues inside the trunk of the palm tree. After reaching the last stage of its life (1-3 months), the caterpillar weaves a cocoon of oval-shaped fibers to pupate inside it for a period of 14-21 days, then the full insect emerges after the expiry of the pupation period. The life cycle of the red palm weevil is estimated at 3-6 months, depending on the season of the year.',

      'A pest that spreads in most areas of palm cultivation in the Kingdom. The adult insect hibernates, where it is under the bases of the leaf and the fibers surrounding the pollen at the palm tree under the fibers. The color of the adult insect is brown, and it is distinguished by the presence of two black spots on the outer surface of the two covers, and the front spot is smaller than the rear and has a proboscis. The harmful instars are the larva and the adult insect. The larva is legless. The appearance of the insect begins before the blossoms open with the beginning of February-April, which is commensurate with the emergence of pollen until after the fruit set.',

      'The so-called mite infects many plant hosts, and it is one of the pests that cause economic losses to the palm crop. The name of the mite came as a dream of dust because the affected fruits are covered with a cobweb secreted by the mite, to which particles of dirt stick. Thus, the infected dates and palm leaves appear as if they have a layer of dust on them, and that is why they are called. Dust mite is spread in many countries of the world and is one of the most dangerous pests that affect date palms, especially in dry areas. The infection increases with lack of irrigation water and neglect in agricultural operations. The percentage of infection and crop loss during dry and hot years.',
